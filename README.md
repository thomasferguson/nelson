# nelson
Nelson is an ontology for the representation of both positive and negative information in a knowledge graph. Typical presentations (e.g. negative property assertions in OWL 2 or no value classes in Wikidata) treat negative information as a second-class citizen. Nelson aims for a more straightforward and even-handed representation of negative information.
